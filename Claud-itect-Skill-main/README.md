# Claude-ITect-Skill

Are you a Claude Architect or as the industry refuses to call us: Claude-ITects™?
Good. You’re in the right place.

Welcome to Claude-ITect-Skill:
The “I don’t want to configure 48 things manually” starter pack for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

What you get (whether you deserve it or not):
- 🧠 48 curated skills
- 🤖 4 agent definitions
- 🪓 Caveman session hooks (one command, no thinking required)
- 🔧 thefuck integration for when your terminal betrays you.

But don’t get distracted by the features.

The real sorcery happens during setup when everything just… works.

No yak shaving. No ritual sacrifices.

Install it. Try it. Judge me harshly afterward.

After installation start with the skill: 
- `/audit`

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** — [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Node.js** (LTS) — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) — required for caveman hooks

---

## Install

### Windows

1. Open **PowerShell** (search "PowerShell" in the Start menu).
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\path\to\your\project"
   ```
3. Run the installer — replace the path with wherever you saved the skill pack:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\Claude-ITect-Skill\install.ps1"
   ```
   To install into a specific project instead of the current directory:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\Claude-ITect-Skill\install.ps1" -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\your\project"
   ```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-Force` | Overwrite skills that already exist |
| `-SkipHooks` | Skip auto-wiring hooks into `settings.json` |

> **Note:** `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` only applies to this one run — it does not change your system settings.

---

### macOS / Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Make the script executable (one-time step):
   ```bash
   chmod +x "/path/to/Claude-ITect-Skill/install.sh"
   ```
3. Navigate to your project and run:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   bash "/path/to/Claude-ITect-Skill/install.sh"
   ```
   Or install into a specific path directly:
   ```bash
   bash "/path/to/Claude-ITect-Skill/install.sh" /path/to/your/project
   ```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--force` | Overwrite skills that already exist |
| `--skip-hooks` | Skip auto-wiring hooks into `settings.json` |

---

### What gets installed

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    ├── skills/     48 skills
    ├── agents/     4 agent definitions
    └── hooks/      6 hook files
```

`settings.json` is patched to wire caveman hooks (SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit). Existing entries are preserved. NgonENGINE-specific commands in `commands-ngon/` are **not** auto-installed. Comment if you want these as well.

---

### After installing

Restart Claude Code. Then run `/audit` to verify the installation. Duplicate skills are uploaded to trigger audit skill to ensure this pack of skills nests within your repository skills efficiently.

## TheFuck

Diagnoses and corrects failed shell commands. Wraps the [`thefuck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) CLI if installed.

**Triggers:** failed command in session, "fix that", "fuck", "what should I have typed", "correct that"

**Behavior:** identifies error class (typo, missing sudo, wrong flag, bad path, etc.), proposes corrected command, confirms before running. Never executes destructive corrections silently.

**Install the CLI (optional):**

```powershell
winget install thefuck          # Windows
```

```bash
brew install thefuck            # macOS
pip install thefuck             # any platform
```

**Add shell alias:**

```bash
# bash/zsh
eval $(thefuck --alias)
```

```powershell
# PowerShell ($PROFILE)
$env:TF_SHELL = "powershell"; iex "$(thefuck --alias)"
```

---

## Agents (4)

Installed to `.claude/agents/`. Spawn via `Agent` tool with `subagent_type`.

| Agent | `subagent_type` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| CaveCrew Builder | `cavecrew-builder` | 1–2 file surgical edits only. Hard refuses 3+ file scope. |
| CaveCrew Investigator | `cavecrew-investigator` | Read-only code locator. Returns `file:line` table. No fix suggestions. |
| CaveCrew Reviewer | `cavecrew-reviewer` | Diff reviewer. One finding per line, severity-tagged. No praise. |
| Geometry Solver | `geometry-solver` | NgonENGINE math — Newell normals, MVC, GJK/EPA, SubRegion, planarity. |

---

## Hooks (6)

Installed to `.claude/hooks/`. Require Node.js.

| File | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `caveman-activate.js` | `SessionStart` | Injects active caveman ruleset into session context |
| `caveman-mode-tracker.js` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Re-injects caveman level reminder each turn |
| `caveman-config.js` | shared | Reads/writes caveman mode config |
| `caveman-stats.js` | on demand | Reads real token counts from session log |
| `caveman-statusline.ps1` | `statusLine` | `[CAVEMAN]` badge in Claude Code status bar (Windows) |
| `package.json` | shared | Hook dependencies |

The install script writes SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit entries into `.claude/settings.json` using the absolute path of the installed hooks directory.

**Status bar badge (optional, Windows):**

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \".claude\\hooks\\caveman-statusline.ps1\""
  }
}
```
